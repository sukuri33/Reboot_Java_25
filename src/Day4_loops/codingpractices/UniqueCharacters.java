/*
Create a class called UniqueCharacters, Write a program that can return the unique characters from a String

	            Ex:
	                input:
	                    AABCCD

	                output:
	                    BD

	            Hint: You will need indexOf() and lastIndexOf()
	                  if the first and last index numbers of the character are same, then it's unique
