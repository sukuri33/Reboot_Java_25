Create a class name DigitLetterSpecialChar and write a program that asks the use to enter a word.
1.If the word starts with a digits, then print "1st character is a digit"
2.if the word starts with a uppercase letter then print "1st character is a uppercase letter"
3.opposite of No.2 for lowercase
4.if the word starts with a special character, then print "1st character is a special character"

import java.util.Scanner;

public class DigitLetterSpecialChar {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Prompt the user to enter a word
        System.out.print("Enter a word: ");
        String word = scanner.nextLine();

        // Ensure the input is not empty
        if (word.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("You must enter a word.");
            return;
        }

        // Get the first character of the word
        char firstChar = word.charAt(0);

        // Check the type of the first character and print the result
        if (Character.isDigit(firstChar)) {
            System.out.println("1st character is a digit.");
        } else if (Character.isUpperCase(firstChar)) {
            System.out.println("1st character is an uppercase letter.");
        } else if (Character.isLowerCase(firstChar)) {
            System.out.println("1st character is a lowercase letter.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("1st character is a special character.");
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}

How It Works:
Prompt for Input: The program asks the user to enter a word.
Validation: If the input is empty, it informs the user to enter a word and exits.
Character Check:
Uses Character.isDigit() to check if the first character is a digit.
Uses Character.isUpperCase() to check if it's an uppercase letter.
Uses Character.isLowerCase() to check if it's a lowercase letter.
If none of the above conditions are met, it's considered a special character.
Output: The program prints the appropriate message based on the first character.

Here's a solution that avoids using the Character class methods like isDigit, isUpperCase, or isLowerCase. Instead, we directly compare the ASCII values of the characters:
import java.util.Scanner;

public class DigitLetterSpecialChar {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // Prompt the user to enter a word
        System.out.print("Enter a word: ");
        String word = scanner.nextLine();

        // Ensure the input is not empty
        if (word.isEmpty()) {
            System.out.println("You must enter a word.");
            return;
        }

        // Get the first character of the word
        char firstChar = word.charAt(0);

        // Check the type of the first character based on ASCII values
        if (firstChar >= '0' && firstChar <= '9') {
            System.out.println("1st character is a digit.");
        } else if (firstChar >= 'A' && firstChar <= 'Z') {
            System.out.println("1st character is an uppercase letter.");
        } else if (firstChar >= 'a' && firstChar <= 'z') {
            System.out.println("1st character is a lowercase letter.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("1st character is a special character.");
        }

        scanner.close();
    }
}
Explanation:
ASCII Ranges:
Digits: '0' to '9' (ASCII range 48–57).
Uppercase letters: 'A' to 'Z' (ASCII range 65–90).
Lowercase letters: 'a' to 'z' (ASCII range 97–122).
Special characters: Any character outside these ranges.
Comparison:
We use conditional checks (>= and <=) to determine the type of the first character based on its ASCII value.
